## Background

_Describe why this project exists in more detail than the elevator pitch. Don't include code examples or other in-depth material. Someone who is familiar with the project should be able to refresh their memory without hitting "page down". As your reader continues through the document, they should receive a progressively greater amount of detail. Answer questions like: The motivation for creating this project. How this project differs from others. Who is this for. What else do readers ned to know to understand this project._

**Example**

We want to make it very easy for employees who publish code to attract positive attention to their work. Some porjects are very complex, so we created an outline to help. This helps publishers gather the information in an organized way. This also helps those who browse our projects get the information they need to decide if this project is relevant to them, and if so, how to proceed. We ask employees who publish new open source projects to adapt these files to meet the needs of your project based on the [Yahoo Open Source Skeleton Specification](Spec-READ-AND-DELETE.md).


## Install

_Describe how to install and use this project. Readers may be novices, but our tone is informative, not condescending. You can point to instructions rather than writing too much here. Remember, if users can't install this project, they will not contribute much to it. Assume they might need information about the programming language version or operating environment information. Don't assume they operate under the same exact conditions we do internally._

**Example**

If you've never used git before, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with [what it is and how it works](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics). To install this project, you'll [need to have git installed and set up](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your local dev environment.

Install by running the following command.

```
git clone <link>
```
This will create a directory called Yahoo-Open-Source-Skeleton and download the contents of this repo to it.
