# Static Project
First, thanks for your interest in our project. Please note, this project is inactive. We published this for you to see it. Maybe it was part of a research paper publication, or a conference presentation. Maybe the people who used to manage it have since moved on to other projects. But we're no longer planning on working on this code. 

You many have questions, issues, feature requests, or code contributions. Active projects welcome those (as described in the normal Contributing.md file). This project is inactive. What can you do next?

* **Research.** By looking at the project information on GitHub, you can find out who was active in this project and reach out to those people directly to find out about the project. They may be willing to address your questions, issues, etc. They may be inclined to re-activate the project too.

* **Fork and Resurrect.** This project is public and under an open source license. You are welcome to fork the project and grow a community around your project fork.
