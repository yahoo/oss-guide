# Special Recordkeeping for Special Projects

Some projects require us to keep records of who we've authorized to contribute to those projects. Below are some of the more common project types and how we handle record keeping. If you contribute to these projects, please review the process listed below. If you have any questions, contact the OSPO on our internal slack channel at #opensource or email ospo@.

## Contribute to Google Projects

Google requires corporate contributors be listed on a list that Verizon Media's OSPO maintains with Google. To contribute to a Google Open Source Project, complete the following steps:

1. Go to your Github [Emails](<https://github.com/settings/emails>) Settings page on your personal GitHub account.
1. Add your verizonmedia.com email address as either a primary or backup email address. This helps Google's Bot determine that you are a Verizon Media employee and your contribution to their project is therefore authorized by our OSPO. Note: You can make your email address private if you like. We ask that you remove it when you leave Verizon Media.
1. Use your verizonmedia.com email address for any contributions to Google projects that you make on behalf of Verizon Media. For example, for projects that use git for source control, use the ``git config`` command to set your email address.
1. Request to be added to the GoogleGroup whitelist for Verizon Media contributors to Google open source projects.

Once we add you to the list, you'll be able to contribute to Google's projects.
